# Diem Explorer

The Diem Explorer is an open-source web-based UI for Diem flavored blockchains which is going to provide a suite of introspection tools for the blockchain.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add diem-explorer https://diem.github.io/explorer
```

You can then run `helm search repo diem-explorer` to see the charts.
